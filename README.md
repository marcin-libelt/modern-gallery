### Live demo 📺

## About the project

This is a Demo website created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Key features 🔑

- ### NextJs 13.4 / ReactJs
  - [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) is the framework for the Web extending the latest React features
- ### TypeScript
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on JavaScript has become a standard in every modern web application, so it could not be missing in this application.
- ### TailwindCss use with design tokens
  - [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a very popular usability-oriented CSS framework. Responsiveness, hover/focus statuses, we write all this in an html markup. It automatically removes unused css styles from the production build. All this makes TailwindCss such a great choice.
  - TailwindCss is great for working with Design Tokens. A little transpiler helps you easily convert tokens into usable Tailwind classes
- ### Virtualized Grid
  - the main purpose of the demo project was to implement virtualized list from scratch but the case was to have responsive grid instead of simple list item. The assumption was not to use any third-party library like react-virtualized.
- ### Semantic DOM and Accessibility
  - DOM structure is not only important for accessibility reasons but also for spreading good web standard.
- ### Usplash photography
  - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) API is very useful, yet their bandwidth limits are small. I decided to mock-up response JSON and use it internally.
